    I am a Master's student in the College of Mechatronics and Control Engineering at 
    <a href="https://www.szu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shenzhen University</a>. 
    My research interests include <strong>Text-to-3D generation</strong>, <strong>diffusion models</strong>, 
    <strong>hypergraph neural networks (HGNN)</strong>, and <strong>LoRA fine-tuning</strong>. 
    I focus on developing parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies and hypergraph-based architectures 
    to advance multimodal learning and high-fidelity 3D content generation.
  </p>
  <p>
    My academic excellence has been recognized with several distinctions, including being named 
    an 🏆 <strong>Outstanding Graduate</strong> of Shenzhen University (2025, <strong>awarded to 333 out of 5,208 graduates</strong>)
